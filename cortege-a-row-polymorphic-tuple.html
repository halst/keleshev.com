        <h1>Cortege: a Row-polymorphic Tuple</h1>

<p><center>2018-03-25</center></p>

<p>Every once in a while I stumble upon some tuple code
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/blob/7d5e40c102792001cd240e38c70c241fafff2d99/utils/misc.ml#L381-L388">like this</a>:</p>

<pre><b>let </b>fst3 (x,_,_) = x
<b>let </b>snd3 (_,x,_) = x
<b>let </b>thd3 (_,_,x) = x

<b>let </b>fst4 (x,_,_,_) = x
<b>let </b>snd4 (_,x,_,_) = x
<b>let </b>thd4 (_,_,x,_) = x
<b>let </b>for4 (_,_,_,x) = x
</pre>

<p>Or even <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tuple-0.3.0.2/docs/src/Data-Tuple-Update.html#Upd1">like this</a>:</p>

<pre><b>instance </b>Upd1 b (a1,a2) (b,a2) <b>where
  </b>upd1 b (a1,a2) = (b,a2)
<b>instance </b>Upd1 b (a1,a2,a3) (b,a2,a3) <b>where
  </b>upd1 b (a1,a2,a3) = (b,a2,a3)
<b>instance </b>Upd1 b (a1,a2,a3,a4) (b,a2,a3,a4) <b>where
  </b>upd1 b (a1,a2,a3,a4) = (b,a2,a3,a4)
<b>instance </b>Upd1 b (a1,a2,a3,a4,a5) (b,a2,a3,a4,a5) <b>where
  </b>upd1 b (a1,a2,a3,a4,a5) = (b,a2,a3,a4,a5)
<b>instance </b>Upd1 b (a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6) (b,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6) <b>where
  </b>upd1 b (a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6) = (b,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6)
<span style='background: lightgrey'>...</span>
</pre>

<p>It always made me wonder if we could do better.
Couldn&#8217;t we come up with a more polymorphic tuple type
for which we could write select, update, and other
functions without the need to duplicate the implementation
for each tuple size?!</p>

<p>There seems to be a gap in our type systems.
We have nominal variants, and their counterparts, row-polymorphic
variants. We have nominal records and row-polymorphic records.
We have tuples. So where are all the row-polymorphic tuples?!</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s employ our wishful thinking and imagine how they might
look like.</p>

<h2>Bananan Notation</h2>

<p>OCaml row-polymorphic object type may look like this:</p>

<pre>< width : int; height : int; .. >
</pre>

<p>The implicit row variable (<code>..</code>) tells us that
more fields are allowed. So why can&#8217;t we say the same about
tuples? Let&#8217;s use banana brackets for our imaginary
row-polymorphic tuple:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>(| 'a, 'b |)</code> would be a two-tuple;</li>
<li><code>(| 'a |)</code> would be a one-tuple;</li>
<li><code>(| |)</code> would be a unit tuple;</li>
<li><code>(| 'a, 'b, .. |)</code> would be a tuple with two elements, possibly more;</li>
<li><code>(| 'a, .. |)</code>—with at least one element, possibly more;</li>
<li><code>(| .. |)</code> would be a possibly empty tuple.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then you could write selector functions
that work for any such tuple of appropriate size.
For example, accessor function for the first element
would require a tuple of size one or more:</p>

<pre><b>val </b>first  : (| 'a, .. |) -> 'a
<b>val </b>second : (| _, 'a, .. |) -> 'a
<b>val </b>third  : (| _, _, 'a, .. |) -> 'a
</pre>

<p>Similar story with polymorphic update functions:</p>

<pre><b>module </b>Update : <b>sig
  </b><b>val </b>first  : 'x -> (| 'a, .. |) -> (| 'x, .. |)
  <b>val </b>second : 'x -> (| 'a, 'b, .. |) -> (| 'a, 'x, .. |)
  <b>val </b>third  : 'x -> (| 'a, 'b, 'c, .. |) -> (| 'a, 'c, 'x, .. |)
<b>end
</b></pre>

As well as other polymorphic functions:

<pre><b>val </b>prepend : 'a -> (| .. |) -> (| 'a, .. |)
<b>val </b>swap : (| 'a, 'b, .. |) -> (| 'b, 'a, .. |)
<b>val </b>tail : (| 'a, .. |) -> (| .. |)
</pre>

<p>I am a little fast-and-loose with notation here.
We would probably need to make row variables explicit
to be able to say that they unify on both sides of an arrow:</p>

<pre><b>val </b>tail : (| 'a, .. <b>as </b>'row |) -> (| .. <b>as </b>'row |)
</pre>

<p>So what is stopping us from having such row-polymorphic tuples
in a language like OCaml?! Nothing, really!</p>

<h2>GADT Cortege</h2>

<p>Here&#8217;s <em>cortege</em>: a row-polymorphic tuple, implemented here using GADT:</p>

<pre><b>module </b>Cortege = <b>struct
  </b><b>type </b>_ t =
    | [] : unit t
    | (::) : 'a * 'b t -> ('a -> 'b) t
<b>end
</b></pre>

At value-level, it is a simple linked list.
We also encode the type of each tuple element inside a type-level linked list.
We could use any type-level linked list, for example:

<pre><b>type </b>nil
<b>type </b>('head, 'tail) cons
</pre>

<p>However, we instead use the <code>unit</code> for nil and <code>(-&gt;)</code> for cons.
Unit type corresponds neatly to our unit cortege, while
the function type <code>(-&gt;)</code> is convenient because of the infix notation.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the correspondence between our notation and the Cortege type:</p>

<pre>(| 'a, 'b |)      ⇒  ('a -> 'b -> unit) Cortege.t
(| 'a |)          ⇒  ('a -> unit) Cortege.t
(| |)             ⇒  unit Cortege.t
(| 'a, 'b, .. |)  ⇒  ('a -> 'b -> 'row) Cortege.t
(| 'a, .. |)      ⇒  ('a -> 'row) Cortege.t
(| .. |)          ⇒  'row Cortege.t
</pre>

<p>Since OCaml version 4.03 we can re-define <code>[]</code> and <code>(::)</code> constructors
to overload the list notation. We use this inside the cortege module
to conveniently construct our row-polymorphic tuples:</p>

<pre><b>let </b>unit = Cortege.[]
<b>let </b>pair a b = Cortege.[a; b]
<b>let </b>triple a b c = Cortege.[a; b; c]
</pre>

<p>Let&#8217;s define accessor functions:</p>

<pre><b>let </b>first  Cortege0.(x :: _) = x
<b>let </b>second Cortege0.(_ :: x :: _) = x
<b>let </b>third  Cortege0.(_ :: _ :: x :: _) = x
</pre>

<p>And check that they work on any sufficiently wide cortege:</p>

<pre><b>assert </b>Cortege.(first [<b>true</b>] = <b>true</b>);
<b>assert </b>Cortege.(first [<b>true</b>; <em>"b"</em>] = <b>true</b>);
<b>assert </b>Cortege.(first [<b>true</b>; <em>"b"</em>; `c] = <b>true</b>);
</pre>

<p>Notice that one-tuple is allowed.
Not sure if it is good or not.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s define update functions:</p>

<pre><b>module </b>Update = <b>struct
  </b><b>let </b>first  x (a :: rest) = x :: rest
  <b>let </b>second x (a :: b :: rest) = a :: x :: rest
  <b>let </b>third  x (a :: b :: c :: rest) = a :: b :: x :: rest
<b>end
</b></pre>

Pattern matching works perfectly. We can both use
the list notation and the cons constructor in patterns:

<pre><b>assert </b><b>begin
  </b><b>match </b>Cortege.[<b><b>true</b></b>; <em>"a"</em>; `b] <b>with
  </b>| Cortege.[<b><b>true</b></b>; _; _] -> <b>true
  </b>| Cortege.(<b>false </b>:: _) -> <b>false
</b><b>end
</b></pre>
As well as our miscelaneous functions:

<pre><b>let </b>prepend a rest = Cortege.(a :: rest)
<b>let </b>swap Cortege.(a :: b :: rest) = Cortege.(b :: a :: rest)
<b>let </b>tail Cortege.(_ :: rest) = rest
</pre>

<h2>Flat Cortege</h2>

<p>While with the GADT cortege we gained a more polymorphic tuple type,
we lost our ability to represent a tuple with a flat array.</p>

<p>But with a little bit of &#8220;magic&#8221; and unsafe casting
we can re-gain our flat array representation:</p>

<pre><b>module </b><b>type </b>CORTEGE = <b>sig
  </b><b>type </b>_ t

  <b>val </b>unit : unit t
  <b>val </b>pair : 'a -> 'b -> ('a -> 'b -> unit) t
  <b>val </b>triple : 'a -> 'b -> 'c -> ('a -> 'b -> 'c -> unit) t

  <b>val </b>prepend : 'head -> 'tail t -> ('head -> 'tail) t

  <b>val </b>first  : ('a -> _) t -> 'a
  <b>val </b>second : (_ -> 'a -> _) t -> 'a
  <b>val </b>third  : (_ -> _ -> 'a -> _) t -> 'a

  <span style='background: lightgrey'>...</span>
<b>end

</b><b>module </b>Array_backed_cortege : CORTEGE = <b>struct
  </b><b>type </b>_ t = int array

  <b>let </b>unit = [||]
  <b>let </b>pair a b = [|Obj.magic a; Obj.magic b|]
  <b>let </b>triple a b c = [|Obj.magic a; Obj.magic b; Obj.magic c|]

  <b>let </b>prepend head tail = Array.append [|Obj.magic head|] tail

  <b>let </b>first  t = Obj.magic (Array.unsafe_get t 0)
  <b>let </b>second t = Obj.magic (Array.unsafe_get t 1)
  <b>let </b>third  t = Obj.magic (Array.unsafe_get t 2)

  <span style='background: lightgrey'>...</span>
<b>end
</b></pre>
<pre>
</pre>

<p>We declare this cortege to be an abstract type backed by an int array.
But behind the compiler&#8217;s back,
we unsafely coerce the values using <code>Obj.magic</code> to fit
our heterogeneous values into the array. To understand why this works
it is useful to know how <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/memory-representation-of-values.html">OCaml represents values at runtime</a>.</p>

<p>We use the same type
parameter structure as we did with GADT to track the types of the contained
values, however, in this case, the type parameter is purely
a phantom type.</p>

<p>We can even use the faster <code>Array.unsafe_get</code>
and <code>Array.unsafe_set</code> in our implementation (which avoid bound checks),
because we have encoded the information about the number of
elements in a cortege using the phantom type.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, consider this implementation
a proof-of-concept that a cortege can be backed by a flat array,
but not something useful in practice (unlike the GADT version).
Notably, the <code>Array_backed_cortege</code> fails in unsafe ways whenever
floats are stored in it, because of OCaml&#8217;s special representation
for float arrays.
We could take that into account and fix the code,
but I would still consider it to be
unpractical without the &#8220;literal&#8221; notation and pattern matching.</p>

<h2>Right? Left? Both!</h2>

<p>We have now established that a row-polymorphic tuple can be expressed
in OCaml type system and that it could be backed by
a flat array. However, if it is a flat array, and not a linked list,
why limit ourselves
to representing the &#8220;tail&#8221; of the tuple as the row type?
Why not the start of the tuple? Why not both?</p>

<p>The row variable can stand for an unknown number of elements at
any position of the tuple: start, middle, or tail:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>(| 'a, 'b, .. |)</code> is a cortege with at least two elements, possibly
more on the right;</li>
<li><code>(| .., 'a, 'b |)</code> would be a cortege with at least two elements, possibly
more on the left;</li>
<li><code>(| 'a, .., 'b |)</code>—with two elements, possibly more in the middle.</li>
</ul>

<p>We could write accessors for last elements:</p>

<pre><b>val </b>last : (| .., 'a |) -> 'a
<b>val </b>last_but_one : (| .., 'a, _ |) -> 'a
</pre>

<p>Update functions alike. Or consider a swap function that swaps
the first and the last
element of any cortege, size two or more:</p>

<pre><b>val </b>swap : (| 'a, .., 'b |) -> (| 'b, .., 'a |)
</pre>

<!--
Not completely sure if it would makes sense in general
to have more than one tow variable: <code>(| 'a, .., 'b, .., 'c |)</code>.
But perhaps this could be useful to concatenate two tuples:

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>Cortege is a solution to the problem of tuples being not flexible
and not polymorphic enough.
However, it could be that we are trying to solve the wrong problem.</p>

<p>Consider Elm, it limits tuples to at most a three-tuple and thus forces the user
to switch to a row-polymorphic record instead.
PureScript doesn&#8217;t have built-in support for tuples at all in the language,
also on purpose.</p>

<p>A counterargument could be that, unlike row-polymorphic records,
corteges have a notion of order, so would fit well with applications
where the order is important. For example, a list of corteges can
model tabular data, like a CSV file, without losing the information
about the column order.</p>

<p>Another argument is that a Cortege could be implemented as a flat array,
unlike a row-polymorphic record.</p>

<p>So it could be that the cortege is a language feature that overlaps too much
with other features, like row-polymorphic records.
Or it could be a useful practical tool, who knows.
I recommend trying to use the GADT cortege for yourself, and over time
together we&#8217;ll learn if it is any good.</p>

<h2>Name</h2>

<p><em>Cortege</em> or <em>кортеж</em> is a French-borrowed Russian word for a tuple.</p>

<h2>Aknowledgements</h2>

<p>Heterogeneous linked lists, like the GADT cortege, are not a new
idea. One reference to it I could find was in
<a href="https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/pull/234">an OCaml compiler pull request</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to my colleague Kristian Støvring for a valuable discussion
and for suggesting to use GADT for row-polymorphic tuples.  <a href="/" title="Home">&#9632;</a></p>
