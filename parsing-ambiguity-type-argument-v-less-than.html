<h1>
Parsing Ambiguity:<br/>Type Argument <em>v.</em> Less Than</h1>

<p><center>2016-06-19</center></p>

<p>In C-family languages, type arguments are usually
delimited with &#8220;angular&#8221; brackets, like this:</p>

<pre>Array&lt;String&gt;
</pre>

<p>In an expression context, the angular brackets could be
confused with infix comparison operators.
Think about the difference between the following two expressions:</p>

<pre>x = Foo&lt;Bar&gt;(1 + 2)

x = foo &lt; bar &gt; (1 + 2)
</pre>

<p>How should the parser determine that the first one
is a constructor call, and the second one is
two infix comparisons?</p>

<p>This problem can be solved on different levels:</p>

<ul>
<li>lexer level,</li>
<li>parser level, or</li>
<li>language design level.</li>
</ul>

<p>First, let&#8217;s start with lexer-level solutions.</p>

<h2>The lexer hack</h2>

<p>We can make lexer keep track of type names.
Every time
we encounter a definition like <code>class Foo</code>,
we add the type name to a symbol table.
Next, when the lexer encounters an identifier,
we check if this identifier is present in that symbol table.
If it is present in the symbol table,
we issue a <code>TYPE_IDENTIFIER</code> token, otherwise an <code>IDENTIFIER</code> token.</p>

<p>This removes the ambiguity for the parser since
<code>TYPE_IDENTIFIER '&lt;'</code> is clearly the start of a type expression,
while <code>IDENTIFIER '&lt;'</code> is a start of a comparison.</p>

<p>This solution is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_lexer_hack">the lexer hack</a>.
It was first used in C.</p>

<p>There are several problems with this solution:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If your language allows forward references, then you
need two separate passes: the first pass to construct the
symbol table, and the second pass that issues the tokens.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on how complex your type declaration
syntax is, you might need to do some actual parsing in your
tokenizer to extract the identifier of your type.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, in C, type declarations can get quite complicated.
Here is some standards-compliant code that shows this:</p>

<pre><b>typedef </b>int (*foo)(int bar, int, baz);
</pre>

<p>Of <em>all</em> the identifiers here, it is not trivial to
determine that &#8220;<code>foo</code>&#8221; is the type being introduced.
Especially during lexing.
For this, you have to do some parsing in your lexer.</p>

<h2>Lexer whitespace sensitivity</h2>

<p>Depending on whitespace surrounding &#8220;<code>&lt;</code>&#8221; and &#8220;<code>&gt;</code>&#8221; symbols,
the lexer can issue different tokens.
For example, if the next token matches a <code>"&lt;\s"</code> regular
expression—issue <code>LESS_THAN</code> token.
Otherwise, if it matches just <code>"&lt;"</code>—issue <code>LEFT_ANGLE_BRACKET</code>.</p>

<p>The reality might be more complicated (or not).
You need to consider cases like this:</p>

<pre>Array&lt;/* hello! */String&gt;
</pre>

<p>One language that takes this approach is Swift.
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/LexicalStructure.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH30-ID418">Swift uses whitespace</a>
to assign meaning to operator tokens.</p>

<p>This solution can be considered a language-level
since it affects the set and meaning of accepted programs.
This solution is also well applicable to lexer-less
parsing techniques, like PEG and classical parser combinators.</p>

<p><center>⁂</center></p>

<p>Now we move onto parser-level solutions.</p>

<h2>Prioritized choice (PEG)</h2>

<p><a href="
https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/parsing:popl04.pdf)
(PEG">Parsing expression grammars</a> have an interesting feature,
the <em>prioritized choice</em> operator &#8220;<code>/</code>&#8221; <em>(forward slash)</em>.
Unlike the regular <em>choice</em> operator
&#8220;<code>|</code>&#8221; <em>(vertical bar)</em>, it
allows one grammar rule to be prioritized over another.</p>

<p>For example, it allows you to say that
we first consider &#8220;<code>&lt;</code>&#8221; to start
a type argument list, and if this interpretation fails
to parse, we backtrack and try to interpret it as an
infix comparison.
Here&#8217;s how a simplified PEG grammar like that can look like:</p>

<pre>constructor_call &lt;-
  identifier '&lt;' type_parameters '&gt;' '(' parameters ')'

infix_expression <-
  identifier (('&lt;' / '&gt;') identifier)*

expression <-
  <em># <code>constructor_call</code> takes priority if ambiguity arises:
</em>  constructor_call / infix_expression / '(' expression ')'
</pre>

<h2>Generalized parsing</h2>

<p>If PEG allows you to make a choice between two production rules,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLR_parser">generalized parsers like GLR</a>
allow you to defer the choice until after parsing.
In the case of syntactic ambiguity,
a GLR parser will produce two parse trees:
one for type expression, another for infix expression.
At a later stage of compilation
(for example, when you construct your symbol tables)
you can make a choice of discarding one of the parse
trees by looking up the identifier in a symbol table.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of this approach is that a GLR parser will
produce multiple parse trees for all ambiguities in
your grammar—whether you know about them in advance or not.</p>

<h2>Hand-written parser</h2>

<p>In case of a hand-written parser, you can do something
similar to the lexer hack but at the parser level.
As you parse, you construct a symbol table for types.
Whenever you encounter an identifier, you look it up in the
type symbol table.</p>

<p>This is how, for example, the
<a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/23a4184e48bf1fe77ae27cbf121c51849157ecbf/compiler/frontend/src/org/jetbrains/kotlin/parsing/KotlinParsing.java#L1966">hand-written Kotlin parser</a> works.</p>

<p><center>⁂</center></p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s move onto the language-level solutions.</p>

<p>The root of our problem is the following:
in the same context, we want to use &#8220;<code>&lt;</code>&#8221; and &#8220;<code>&gt;</code>&#8221;
symbols as both infix operators and as distinct parenthesis-like
delimiters.
So the ambiguity is inherent to the problem.</p>

<p>A language-level solution would be to use
a different syntax for the two cases.</p>

<h2>Scala solution</h2>

<p>One example of this is Scala, which uses
square brackets as type parameters which avoids the problem
altogether:</p>

<pre>x = Foo[Bar](1 + 2)

x = foo &lt; bar &gt; (1 + 2
</pre>

<p>While &#8220;<code>&lt;</code>&#8221; and &#8220;<code>&gt;</code>&#8221; are always parsed as infix operators,
&#8220;<code>[</code>&#8221; and &#8220;<code>]</code>&#8221; are always parsed as parenthesis-like
matching delimiters. So there&#8217;s no confusion.</p>

<h2>Rust solution</h2>

<p>Rust is one of the languages that continues the tradition
of using &#8220;<code>&lt;</code>&#8221; and &#8220;<code>&gt;</code>&#8221; symbols for both type parameters and infix
comparison operators.
However, in an expression context, it requires the
programmer to explicitly disambiguate them by using
a &#8220;<code>::&lt;</code>&#8221; sequence. Consider:</p>

<pre><b>let </b>x: foo::Foo&lt;Bar&gt; = foo::Foo::&lt;Bar&gt;(1 + 2);
</pre>

<p><em>(Having both type annotations is not necessary here, but nevertheless…)</em></p>

<p>Inside the type annotation, you can write <code>Foo&lt;Bar&gt;</code>,
because it is a type-only context.
However, in an expression context, you need to write <code>Foo::&lt;Bar&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><center>⁂</center></p>

<p>You can classify the above solutions into syntactic and
semantic ones.</p>

<p>Syntactic solutions are those that make the decision
solely based on the syntax,
in our case:</p>

<ul>
<li>lexer whitespace sensitivity, and</li>
<li>prioritized choice (PEG).</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these accept slightly different languages.</p>

<p>Semantic solutions are those that rely on a symbol table
for types to disambiguate:</p>

<ul>
<li>the lexer hack,</li>
<li>generalized parsing, and</li>
<li>hand-written parser.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thes three solutions accept the same language.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re implementing an existing language,
you should carefully read the spec (if one exists)
to see which of the solutions could be applicable.
However, if you&#8217;re designing a new language,
you have the power to come up with a syntax that is not
conceptually ambiguous.
Scala and Rust are good examples of this approach.
