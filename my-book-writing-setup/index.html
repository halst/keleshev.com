<h1>My Book-writing Setup</h1>

<p><center>2020-04-12</center></p>

<p>As you probably know,
I&#8217;m writing a book called
<a href="/compiling-to-assembly-from-scratch-the-book">Compiling to Assembly from Scratch</a>.
Recently I
<a href="https://twitter.com/keleshev/status/1246720964790046721">tweeted</a>
about my book-writing setup, and
there was a lot of interest in the
details of my setup.
I&#8217;m only halfway through
with writing the book (or, so I think),
so my setup will likely to change as I go.
But here it is, anyway.</p>

<p>A screenshot:</p>

<p><a href=screenshot.png><img src=screenshot.png width=100% height=100% /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m on macOS, so I&#8217;m using the native
full-screen split functionality.
On the left, I have Terminal.app running Vim,
and on the right, I have Preview.app
showing—ahem—a preview.
Both apps ship with macOS.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing the book in Markdown,
then use Pandoc to convert it to PDF and EPUB.</p>

<h2>Pandoc</h2>

<p>I use <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> as my
Markdown processor.
It is a great tool, written in Haskell, and available
from most package managers.
It converts from and to many different document formats.
Still, I am mainly interested in PDF and EPUB for my book.</p>

<p>While Pandoc supports CommonMark and GitHub-flavored Markdown,
I am using the Pandoc dialect of Markdown.
It has support for many extensions:
footnotes, different styles of tables, math, etc.</p>

<p>For example, the table style that I&#8217;m using in the
screenshot allows changing column width and
proportions by changing the Markdown column widths.</p>

<p>Although I&#8217;m using Make to run Pandoc, here&#8217;s
an equivalent shell command:</p>

<pre>$ pandoc book.md -o book.pdf           \
    --table-of-contents                \
    --number-sections                  \
    --pdf-engine=xelatex               \
    --indented-code-classes=javascript \
    --highlight-style=monochrome       \
    -V mainfont=<em>"Palatino"</em>             \
    -V documentclass=report            \
    -V papersize=A5                    \
    -V geometry<em>:margin=1in</em>
</pre>

<p>By default, to produce PDF, Pandoc converts the document to LaTeX first, then calls <code>pdflatex</code> to produce the PDF.
Howerver, with <code>--pdf-engine=xelatex</code> I opted in to use
XeTeX together with <code>xelatex</code> command to produce PDF.</p>

<p>First, XeTeX allows to use Unicode characters in the source
of the document. I&#8217;m quite accustomed to entering
en-dash and em-dash and other special characters
using option-key shortcuts on macOS.
Second, XeTeX allows to use arbitrary system&#8217;s fonts,
and that&#8217;s what I did with <em>Palatino</em>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve set up some preliminary paper size and margin
and LaTeX <code>documentclass</code>, but I will definitely be
tweaking them before releasing the book.</p>

<p>Producing EPUB with Pandoc also works fine,
but I&#8217;m sure I will do more tweaking there
as well:</p>

<h2>Figures</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="https://draw.io">draw.io</a>
for various diagrams at work and for this blog.
But for the book, I wanted to use something open-source,
something reliable, something that would not
<em>incredible journey</em> me over halfway through writing
the book, leaving me without a critical tool.</p>

<p>So I started searching, and imagine my surprise when
I learn that draw.io is, in fact,
<a href="https://github.com/jgraph/drawio">open-source</a>.
That was a relief!</p>

<p><a href=drawio.png><img src=drawio.png width=100% height=100% /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using one big draw.io document so far
and I exported individual figures to SVG
by using <em>export selection</em> feature.</p>

<p>SVG is well supported with EPUB, since EPUB
is just glorified HTML and CSS under-the-hood.
For PDF output, Pandoc requires to install
<code>librsvg</code> (written in Rust) and handles
the conversion transparently.</p>

<h2>Makefile</h2>

<p>Even though my book right now is written in a single
Markdown file, I started using Make anyway
from the get-go.
I&#8217;m using my system&#8217;s build-in GNU Make.
Here&#8217;s my Makefile:</p>

<pre>.PHONY: phony

FIGURES = $(shell find . -name '*.svg')

PANDOCFLAGS =                        \
  --table-of-contents                \
  --pdf-engine=xelatex               \
  --from=markdown                    \
  --number-sections                  \
  --indented-code-classes=javascript \
  --highlight-style=monochrome       \
  -V mainfont=<em>"Palatino"</em>             \
  -V documentclass=report            \
  -V papersize=A5                    \
  -V geometry<em>:margin=1in</em>

all: phony output/book.pdf

output/%.pdf: %.md $(FIGURES) Makefile | output
        pandoc $< -o $@ $(PANDOCFLAGS)

output/%.epub: %.md $(FIGURES) Makefile | output
        pandoc $< -o $@ $(PANDOCFLAGS)

output:
        mkdir ./output

clean: phony
        rm -rf ./output

open: phony output/book.pdf
        open output/book.pdf
</pre>

<p>A few things that are worth mentioning:</p>

<p><code>Makefile</code> itself is a dependency of some rules.
This is done so that if I change a
font (or some other Pandoc flag),
Make would pick it up and rebuild the target.</p>

<p>The list of all figures (<code>*.svg</code> glob)
is a dependency as well, to make sure that the book
is rebuilt when a figure is updated.</p>

<p>The build artifacts are stored in the <code>output</code> folder,
which is an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Prerequisite-Types.html">order-only prerequisite</a>
(specified with &#8220;<code>| output</code>&#8221; syntax).
This is useful because we don&#8217;t care about the timestamp
of this directory, only that it exists.</p>

<p>I have a special &#8220;<code>.PHONY: phony</code>&#8221; rule, that
allows me to write:</p>

<pre>clean: phony
        rm -rf ./output
</pre>

<p>Instead of the usual:</p>

<pre>.PHONY: clean
clean:
        rm -rf ./output
</pre>

<p>Note that this trick can slow down huge Makefiles.</p>

<p>To be honest, this is mostly just me flexing my
knowledge of Make, rather than anything useful.
A small build script could do just as well.</p>

<h2>Vim</h2>

<p>I am using the version of Vim that ships with macOS,
with minimal tuning.
The only <code>~/.vimrc</code> option worth mentioning here
is <code>virtualedit</code>:</p>

<pre>set virtualedit=all
</pre>

<p>It allows to move the cursor past the last character.
If you insert a new character there,
it is automatically padded with spaces.
It is easier to see it than to explain it:</p>

<p><img src=virtualedit.gif width=100% height=100% /></p>

<p>This is very useful for dealing with tables and much more!
In fact, I use this option for all my editing
in Vim for about a decade now.
My first programming environment was
Turbo Pascal, and this is exactly how the
cursor works there, which I grew accustomed to.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s about it.
When I finish my book, I will write a new blog
post about any significant changes to this process.
